a0290d2  defconfigs: regenerate for zen decision  [Alx31]
9eeefc3  msm: zen_decision: Don't set default settings in zd_probe  [Alx31]
96b7d33  msm: zen_decision: I'm a dummy - Correctly allow bat_threshold_ignore to be changed in the userspace...  [Alx31]
378c66f  msm: zen_decision: Missed f(x) name change  [Alx31]
f2a581b  msm: zen_decision: Only call INIT_DELAYED_WORK once - Only call it once, not every time we want to run a thread - Rename some functions for clarity  [Alx31]
dad01a4  msm: zen_decision: change queue_delayed_work_on to queue_delayed_work - Not necessary to explicitly queue work on CPU0 anymore  [Alx31]
5a95f9a  msm: zen_decision: Use WQ_UNBOUND and max_active = 1 when allocating WQ - Set WQ_UNBOUND flag on alloc_workqueue which gives the CPU scheduler freedom to move it to other CPUs - Pass 1 as max_active, ensure only 1 task is running at a time from the WQ  [Alx31]
cf2259e  msm: zen_decision: remove unnecessary logic - The iteration over offline CPUs doesn't need an explicit check for CPU0 because CPU0 will never be part of the iteration.  [Alx31]
8137380  msm_zen_decision: some cleanups - Cleanup some commnets and Kconfig description  [Alx31]
febe97b  msm: zen_decision v2.0 - Different functionality than v1.0, the following is the complete functionality: - On screen ON, queue worker thread to bring all CPUs online after wake_wait_time - If current "battery" device level is <= bat_threshold_ignore, don't do any CPU_UP work to account for MSMThermal default activity  [Alx31]
f1a6624  msm_zen_decision: disable by default - What this does now with screen off/on doesn't really have a point. I thought MPDec was messing with this before. - Leaving for future expansion  [Alx31]
cc9b81e  msm_zen_decision: use per-cpu mutex to synchronize hotplug operations  [Alx31]
99289e7  msm_zen_decision: General fixes and cleanup - Actually use "enabled" to disable the driver - Actually allow suspend_wait_time to change > 0 - Restrict suspend_wait_time to a maximum of 60s  [Alx31]
4212661  msm: add msm_zen_decision This adds a simple driver intended to allow the MPDecision service to be disabled. The driver is easily extendable, but currently it: - Can be enabled/disabled in /sys/kernel/zen_decision/enabled - On screen power OFF it removes all cpu cores after suspend_wait_time - On screen power ON it enables all cpu cores. - /sys/kernel/zen_decision/suspend_wait_time (ms) refers to how long we wait after screen is off to remove the cores (default 5s). This just to avoid removing cores in excess.  [Alx31]

46ce759  mako_hotplug: run the main work only once every second if special cases apply  [Alx31]
46a7692  mako_hotplug: don't offline cores if the load at that sample is above the threshold, even if we met all the other conditions  [Alx31]
ac48d76  mako_hotplug: let's use an unbound wq  [Alx31]

35ad321  bfs: add full cpumask LLC (last level cache) cpu selection - From alfred chen 3.19.y-gc branch Includes the following from upstream as pre-requisites: - 8d65775d "cpufreq: handle calls to -> target_index() in separate routine - 1c03a2d0 "cpufreq: add support for intermediate (stable) frequencies"  [Alx31]
